# Building Nile Labs Culture

## The Culture We're Creating

### Core Behaviors to Encourage
1. **Check Labs voluntarily** - It becomes the "fun" dashboard
2. **Share experiments proudly** - "Check out what I'm building"
3. **Fork liberally** - Building on others' ideas is celebrated
4. **Update regularly** - Progress nodes become mini-celebrations
5. **Graduate experiments** - Moving to production is the win

## Weekly Rituals Exploration

### Friday 4pm: "Labs & Libations" üç∫
*Virtual or in-person depending on team location*

**Format:**
- 15 mins: Demo roulette (random person shows experiment)
- 10 mins: Fork of the week (most interesting fork/evolution)
- 5 mins: New experiments roundup
- Social time: Discuss what you're building next

**Rules:**
- No slides allowed - show the thing
- Failures celebrated equally with successes
- "I learned that..." is the phrase of choice

### Monday Morning: "The Pulse Check"
*Async - happens individually*

- Check the activity feed first thing
- React/comment on weekend experiments
- Add a progress update to your active experiment
- Fork something that inspires you

## Recognition Systems

### Automated (via Activity Feed)
- "üî• Hot streak: 5 days of updates"
- "üå± First experiment published"
- "üîÄ First fork created"
- "üöÄ Experiment graduated to production"
- "üë• First collaboration formed"

### Manual (Team/Leadership)
- **Experiment of the Month** - Chosen by team vote
- **Mad Scientist Award** - Wildest experiment attempted
- **The Shipping News** - Experiments that became client work
- **Fork Chain Champion** - Longest fork genealogy

## Launch Activation Plan

### Week -1: Leadership Priming
**Tiernan goes first with:**
1. One successful experiment
2. One failed experiment with good learnings
3. One wild "what if" idea

**Other leaders add:**
- Their own "silly" experiments
- Things they tried that didn't work
- Current curiosities

### Week 1: Team Trip Workshop (2.5 hours)

**Hour 1: Inspiration**
- Show the platform (5 mins)
- Demo 3 wildly different experiments (10 mins)
- "Worst Idea Brainstorm" - compete for most ridiculous (15 mins)
- Break into pairs (30 mins): "Build something stupid"

**Hour 2: Building**
- Create experiments on platform (30 mins)
- Fork someone else's idea (15 mins)
- Add progress updates (15 mins)

**Hour 0.5: Celebration**
- Quick demos of what got built
- Vote on "Most Likely to Accidentally Become Product"
- Toast to experimentation

### Month 1: Momentum Building

**Week 1:**
- Daily Slack reminder: "What are you experimenting with today?"
- Leadership posts 1 update daily

**Week 2:**
- First Friday Labs & Libations
- Announce Experiment of the Week

**Week 3:**
- First "graduation" - make it a big deal
- Share Labs in all-hands

**Week 4:**
- Month 1 retrospective
- Adjust based on what's working

## Language & Framing

### Words We Use
- "What are you experimenting with?"
- "I'm playing with..."
- "Check out this finding"
- "I learned that..."
- "Want to fork this with me?"
- "This graduated to production!"

### Words We Avoid
- "Failed"
- "Didn't work"
- "Waste of time"
- "Just playing around"
- "Not important"
- "When I have time"

## Overcoming Specific Barriers

### "I don't have time"
**Response:** "What's a 30-minute experiment you could try?"
**Ritual:** Thursday 3pm = Labs Power Hour

### "I don't know what to build"
**Response:** "What annoyed you this week? Fix it."
**Ritual:** Problem of the Week challenge

### "My idea is too small/silly"
**Response:** "The spreadsheet that became Fleming started as a silly idea"
**Ritual:** Celebrate tiny experiments equally

### "What if it doesn't work?"
**Response:** "Then you'll have findings to share"
**Ritual:** "Best Findings" award each month

## Measuring Cultural Success

### Quantitative
- Daily active users on platform
- Experiments created per person
- Fork rate
- Graduation rate
- Update frequency

### Qualitative
- Labs mentioned in client conversations
- Experiments referenced in proposals
- Cross-team collaborations formed
- "Check out my Labs" in email signatures
- Unsolicited demos in team meetings

## Anti-Patterns to Watch For

### Signs Culture Isn't Working
- Only same 3 people participating
- Experiments abandoned after creation
- No forks or collaborations
- Platform only updated before meetings
- Experiments all "practical" - no weird ones

### Interventions
- Leadership does something weird and public
- Mandatory "Bad Idea Friday"
- Pair people for forced collaborations
- Kill all meetings for a "Labs Day"
- Reset with simpler platform if needed

## The North Star

**Success looks like:**
People checking Labs with their morning coffee, not because they have to, but because they're genuinely curious what their colleagues are building.

**The test:**
If we turned off the platform tomorrow, would people complain? If yes, we've built the right culture.

*Remember: The platform serves the culture, not the other way around. If the rituals aren't creating energy, change them.*
