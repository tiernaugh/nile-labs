# Session 004

## Session Summary
Continuing from Session 003's functional prototype, implementing Phase 4 Key Flows: browse page with filters, single experiment view, and fork functionality. Advisor feedback from Session 003 has been incorporated (circular ref fixed, semantic sorting, tag normalization, 30 experiments).

## Key Decisions Made

- **Polling approach**: Keep simple 8s interval with pause on background
- **Delete visibility**: Hide delete/restore from main feed for v1
- **Design tokens**: Defer to post-demo, use Tailwind defaults
- **tRPC retention**: Document in ADR-004 as temporary for mocks
- **Search debounce**: 200ms confirmed
- **Fork UX**: One-click with modal confirmation
- **Grid layout**: Responsive with mobile list view

## Files Changed

### Created (This Session)
- `/02 Areas/Session Context/Session-004.md` - This session context
- `/nile-labs/src/app/experiments/page.tsx` - Browse page with filters and sorting
- `/nile-labs/src/app/experiments/[id]/page.tsx` - Single experiment view with fork modal
- `/nile-labs/src/components/experiments/ExperimentGrid.tsx` - Responsive grid layout
- `/nile-labs/src/components/experiments/ExperimentFilters.tsx` - Filter sidebar with search
- `/nile-labs/src/components/experiments/ProgressTimeline.tsx` - Timeline with add capability

### Modified
- `/02 Areas/Frontend Prototype/Implementation-Plan.md` - Updated Phase 4 progress

## Current State

### What's Working (From Session 003)
- Complete type system with all PRD-001 models
- 30 mock experiments with varied data
- tRPC/React Query with 8s polling
- Activity feed with pulse indicator
- 5-second creation form
- Experiment cards with status badges
- Semantic status ordering implemented
- Tag normalization in place
- Circular reference bug fixed

### What's Completed (This Session)
- ✅ Browse page with grid layout and responsive design
- ✅ Filter sidebar with status, category, and search (200ms debounce)
- ✅ Sort options with semantic status ordering
- ✅ Single experiment view with full details
- ✅ Fork functionality with modal confirmation
- ✅ Progress timeline component with add capability
- ✅ Breadcrumb navigation integrated

### What's Remaining
- Pagination/load more functionality
- Mobile filter drawer
- Edit experiment page
- Polish and accessibility improvements

### What's Blocked
- None

## Next Steps

1. [x] Build browse page with grid layout
2. [x] Add filter sidebar (status, category, owner, search)
3. [x] Implement single experiment view
4. [x] Add fork functionality with modal
5. [x] Create progress timeline component
6. [x] Add breadcrumb navigation
7. [ ] Implement pagination/load more
8. [ ] Add mobile filter drawer
9. [ ] Create edit experiment page
10. [ ] Polish with empty states and loading

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should fork modal show diff preview?
- [ ] Include experiment history in single view?
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions?
- [ ] Show fork count badge on cards?

## Context for Next Session

### Critical Information
- **Browse page complete**: Grid with filters, search (200ms debounce), and semantic sorting
- **Single view ready**: Full details with timeline, fork modal, delete/restore
- **Fork flow working**: One-click with modal for title/description editing
- **Phase 4 mostly complete**: Key flows implemented, pagination remaining
- **App tested**: Running successfully on localhost:3002

### Technical Setup
```typescript
// Browse page with filters
import { useExperiments } from "~/lib/hooks/useExperiments";
const { data, isLoading } = useExperiments({
  status: selectedStatuses,
  category: selectedCategories,
  search: debouncedSearch
});

// Single experiment
import { useExperiment } from "~/lib/hooks/useExperiments";
const { data: experiment } = useExperiment(id);

// Fork experiment
const forkMutation = useForkExperiment();
await forkMutation.mutateAsync({ parentId: experiment.id });
```
