# Session 002

## Session Summary
Processed extensive advisor feedback, updated all core documentation with clarifications, established anti-sprawl documentation principles, and prepared the project structure for T3/Next.js development. Key decisions include using polling for activity feed, Biome for formatting, and organizing docs by feature area.

## Key Decisions Made

- **Documentation Organization**: Feature-based folders in `/03 Documentation/` with anti-sprawl principles
- **Canonical Documents Only**: One source of truth per topic, update don't duplicate
- **Polling Strategy**: 8-second intervals with React Query for activity feed (no WebSockets in v1)
- **Categories Finalized**: UK consultancy-specific (Service Design, Strategy & Innovation, etc.)
- **Fork Visualization**: Deferred to v1.1 (after CRUD + feed)
- **Cover Images**: Simple colour blocks/placeholders for v1 (no uploads)
- **Soft Delete**: Added capability for experiments
- **Collaborators**: Must be existing users with invite prompt
- **Progress Updates**: Text-only for v1
- **Biome over ESLint**: For linting and formatting
- **Project Structure**: `nile-labs/` folder for Next.js deployment
- **Team Trip**: September target date

## Files Changed

### Created
- `/03 Documentation/CLAUDE.md` - Documentation organization guide with anti-sprawl rules
- `/03 Documentation/platform-core/ADR-004-State-Management-Polling.md` - Polling and state strategy
- `/nile-labs/README.md` - Project folder for Next.js app
- `/02 Areas/Session Context/2024-08-25-Session-Context.md` - This session context

### Modified
- `/03 Documentation/platform-core/PRD-001-Platform-v1.md` - Updated to v1.3 with all clarifications
- `/03 Documentation/platform-core/ADR-001-Technical-Architecture.md` - Added Biome, updated to v1.3
- `/03 Documentation/Documentation-Standards.md` - Added canonical document principles
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Added anti-sprawl instructions for AI

### Reorganized
- Moved all PRDs/ADRs to `/03 Documentation/platform-core/` folder
- Archived superseded v1 PRD to `/04 Archive/`

## Current State

### What's Working
- Clear documentation structure with anti-sprawl principles
- All advisor questions answered and documented
- Ready for T3/Next.js setup with clear tech decisions
- Project folder structure prepared for development

### What's In Progress
- Ready to scaffold T3 app in `nile-labs/`
- Frontend prototype phase about to begin

### What's Blocked
- Clerk account setup (for Phase 2)
- Vercel project creation (for deployment)
- Stakeholder availability for prototype review

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Set up T3 app in `nile-labs/` with TypeScript, Tailwind, Biome
2. [ ] Create mock data structure matching PRD-001 schema
3. [ ] Build landing page with activity feed
4. [ ] Implement experiment cards with all states
5. [ ] Create 5-second experiment creation flow
6. [ ] Add progress timeline with "+" button
7. [ ] Implement polling with React Query (8-second intervals)
8. [ ] Add soft delete functionality
9. [ ] Create colour block placeholders for cover images

## Open Questions

- [ ] Specific colour palette for cover image blocks?
- [ ] Should we create a design system document?
- [ ] Any specific Nile brand guidelines to follow?
- [ ] Who are the specific stakeholders for prototype review?
- [ ] Exact format for progress update timeline display?

## Context for Next Session

### Critical Information
- **Start with T3 setup**: Use `pnpm create t3-app@latest` in `nile-labs/`
- **Configure Biome**: Replace default ESLint/Prettier with Biome
- **Mock Data First**: Build complete UI before any backend
- **Polling Strategy**: 8-second intervals using React Query
- **Categories**: Use the UK consultancy list from PRD-001 v1.3
- **No Real Features**: No auth, no DB, no image uploads in Phase 1

### Technical Setup
```bash
cd nile-labs
pnpm create t3-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --app --no-trpc
pnpm add -D @biomejs/biome
pnpm add @tanstack/react-query
pnpm add lucide-react
```

### References
- PRD-001 v1.3 - Latest requirements with all clarifications
- ADR-004 - Polling and state management patterns
- ADR-003 - Frontend-first prototyping approach
- Advisory feedback - All questions answered

## Ideas Parked for Later

- Fork visualization (galaxy view) - v1.1
- Real-time updates with WebSockets - v2
- AI brief generator - v2
- Slack integration - Post-launch
- Image uploads for cover images - Phase 2
- Comments/discussions - v2

## Session Metadata
