# Session 001

## Session Summary
Initial project setup for Nile Labs platform. Reviewed existing documentation, created advisory panel for strategic guidance, made key technical decisions (Clerk auth, frontend-first prototyping), and established comprehensive documentation structure with PRDs, ADRs, and session context system.

## Key Decisions Made

- **Frontend-First Prototyping**: Build complete UI with mock data before any backend work to validate UX and get stakeholder buy-in
- **Clerk over NextAuth**: Use Clerk for authentication instead of NextAuth for better out-of-box experience
- **Status Model**: "Findings" instead of "Archived", plus "In Production" for graduated experiments
- **5-Second Creation**: Only title and description required to create experiment
- **Advisory Panel**: Created 8-person dream team to channel for strategic decisions
- **Documentation Structure**: Formal PRDs/ADRs in `/03 Documentation/`, working docs in `/02 Areas/`

### Modified
- PRD and ADR updated from v1.0 to v1.2 with Clerk auth and frontend-first approach

## Current State

### What's Working
- Clear project philosophy: "Platform serves experiments"
- Strong documentation structure established
- Advisory panel providing diverse perspectives
- Frontend-first approach aligned with rapid iteration needs

### What's In Progress
- Project is in Frontend Prototyping phase
- Ready to start building UI with mock data

### What's Blocked
- Need team trip date for launch timeline
- Need Clerk account setup
- Need stakeholder availability for prototype reviews

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Set up Next.js 15 project with TypeScript and Tailwind
2. [ ] Create mock data structure for experiments
3. [ ] Build homepage with activity feed using mock data
4. [ ] Create experiment card component with all states
5. [ ] Implement 5-second creation flow
6. [ ] Add progress timeline with "+" button interaction

## Open Questions

- [ ] Team trip date?
- [ ] Specific categories for Nile's consulting work?
- [ ] Who are the stakeholders for prototype review?
- [ ] What default cover images should we provide?
- [ ] Should we have experiment templates beyond just forkable examples?

## Context for Next Session

### Critical Information
- **Philosophy**: This platform is itself an experiment - keep it lightweight
- **Lloyd's Priority**: Client-facing value, not internal efficiency
- **Key Success Metric**: People checking voluntarily with morning coffee
- **Development Approach**: Complete frontend first, then wire up backend
- **Auth**: Using Clerk, not NextAuth
- **Database**: Vercel Postgres with Prisma when we get to Phase 2

### Technical Setup
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui
- Clerk for auth (Phase 2)
- Prisma + Vercel Postgres (Phase 2)

## Ideas Parked for Later

- AI brief generator (v2 consideration)
- Slack integration for notifications
- Public showcase mode
- Analytics dashboard
- Galaxy visualization for fork relationships
- Experiment templates marketplace
