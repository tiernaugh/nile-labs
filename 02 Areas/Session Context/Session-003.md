# Session 003

## Session Summary
Reviewed advisor feedback on implementation plan, made key architectural decisions, and built the complete data layer foundation for the frontend prototype. Set up TypeScript types, mock data, tRPC integration with React Query, and custom hooks with proper polling behavior per ADR-004.

## Key Decisions Made

- **Keep tRPC/React Query**: Repurpose existing infrastructure for mock data instead of removing
- **Centralized data layer**: Created `/lib/data/` abstraction for easy Phase 2 migration
- **Deterministic colors**: Hash-based HSL generation for cover placeholders
- **Polling implementation**: Exact ADR-004 behaviors (8s interval, pause on blur, refetch on focus)
- **Soft delete included**: With restore capability in UI
- **Activity event types**: All 5 types from PRD-001 implemented
- **Search debouncing**: 200ms as recommended by advisor
- **Mock user context**: Simple user switching for prototype testing

## Files Changed

### Created
- `/nile-labs/src/lib/types.ts` - Complete TypeScript type definitions
- `/nile-labs/src/lib/data/mock-data.ts` - Realistic mock data with 8 experiments
- `/nile-labs/src/lib/data/experiments.ts` - All CRUD operations for experiments
- `/nile-labs/src/lib/data/activities.ts` - Activity feed operations and grouping
- `/nile-labs/src/server/api/routers/experiments.ts` - tRPC router with mock resolvers
- `/nile-labs/src/lib/hooks/useActivityFeed.ts` - Custom hook with polling behavior
- `/nile-labs/src/lib/hooks/useExperiments.ts` - Hooks for all experiment operations
- `/02 Areas/Frontend Prototype/Implementation-Plan.md` - Detailed implementation plan

### Modified
- `/nile-labs/src/server/api/root.ts` - Added experiments router
- `/02 Areas/Session Context/Session-003.md` - This session context

## Current State

### What's Working
- Complete type system matching PRD-001 v1.3
- Mock data layer with all CRUD operations
- tRPC integration providing typed API
- React Query hooks with proper polling
- Activity feed data structure with grouping
- Fork lineage tracking
- Soft delete/restore capability

### What's In Progress
- Ready to build UI components
- Activity feed component next
- 5-second creation form to follow

### What's Blocked
- None - ready to proceed with UI

## Next Steps

1. [x] Set up types and data model
2. [x] Create data abstraction layer
3. [x] Convert tRPC to mock resolvers
4. [ ] Build activity feed UI component
5. [ ] Implement 5-second creation form
6. [ ] Create experiment card component
7. [ ] Build browse page with filters
8. [ ] Add single experiment view
9. [ ] Implement fork UI
10. [ ] Add accessibility features

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should we add loading skeletons now or in polish phase?
- [ ] Include mock authentication UI or just context?
- [ ] Add virtualization for large lists immediately?
- [ ] Create design tokens file now?

## Context for Next Session

### Critical Information
- **Data layer complete**: All mock operations ready in `/lib/data/`
- **Hooks ready**: Use `useActivityFeed()` and `useExperiments()` 
- **Polling working**: 8-second intervals with visibility handling
- **Types defined**: Import from `/lib/types.ts`
- **Mock data seeded**: 8 experiments, various statuses, activity events

### Technical Setup
```typescript
// Activity feed usage
import { useActivityFeed } from "~/lib/hooks/useActivityFeed";
const { activities, pulse, isLoading } = useActivityFeed();

// Experiments usage  
import { useExperiments, useCreateExperiment } from "~/lib/hooks/useExperiments";
const { data: experiments } = useExperiments({ status: [ExperimentStatus.Active] });

// Create experiment
const createMutation = useCreateExperiment();
await createMutation.mutateAsync({ title, description });
```
