# Session 003

## Session Summary
Reviewed advisor feedback on implementation plan, made key architectural decisions, and built the complete data layer foundation for the frontend prototype. Set up TypeScript types, mock data, tRPC integration with React Query, and custom hooks with proper polling behavior per ADR-004. Continued implementation to fix critical issues and build core UI components including activity feed, 5-second creation form, and experiment cards.

## Key Decisions Made

- **Keep tRPC/React Query**: Repurpose existing infrastructure for mock data instead of removing
- **Centralized data layer**: Created `/lib/data/` abstraction for easy Phase 2 migration
- **Deterministic colors**: Hash-based HSL generation for cover placeholders
- **Polling implementation**: Exact ADR-004 behaviors (8s interval, pause on blur, refetch on focus)
- **Soft delete included**: With restore capability in UI
- **Activity event types**: All 5 types from PRD-001 implemented
- **Search debouncing**: 200ms as recommended by advisor
- **Mock user context**: Simple user switching for prototype testing

## Current State

### What's Working
- Complete type system matching PRD-001 v1.3
- Mock data layer with all CRUD operations
- tRPC integration providing typed API
- React Query hooks with proper polling
- Activity feed data structure with grouping
- Fork lineage tracking
- Soft delete/restore capability
- **NEW: Activity feed UI with pulse indicator**
- **NEW: 5-second creation form with keyboard flow**
- **NEW: Experiment cards with status badges**
- **NEW: Homepage with responsive layout**
- **NEW: 30 mock experiments for testing**
- **NEW: Time-ago utility and helpers**

### What's In Progress
- Browse page with filters
- Single experiment view
- Fork functionality UI

### What's Blocked
- None - prototype is functional!

## Next Steps

1. [x] Set up types and data model
2. [x] Create data abstraction layer
3. [x] Convert tRPC to mock resolvers
4. [x] Build activity feed UI component
5. [x] Implement 5-second creation form
6. [x] Create experiment card component
7. [x] Fix critical issues from advisor feedback
8. [x] Add 30 mock experiments for testing
9. [ ] Build browse page with filters
10. [ ] Add single experiment view
11. [ ] Implement fork UI
12. [ ] Polish and accessibility improvements

## Open Questions

- [ ] Should we add loading skeletons now or in polish phase?
- [ ] Include mock authentication UI or just context?
- [ ] Add virtualization for large lists immediately?
- [ ] Create design tokens file now?

## Context for Next Session

### Critical Information
- **Frontend prototype functional**: Homepage with activity feed and creation form working
- **Data layer complete**: All mock operations ready in `/lib/data/`
- **UI components built**: ActivityFeed, QuickCreateForm, ExperimentCard
- **Polling working**: 8-second intervals per ADR-004
- **Mock data rich**: 30 experiments for testing
- **App runs on**: http://localhost:3002 (port 3000 was in use)

### Technical Setup
```typescript
// Activity feed usage
import { useActivityFeed } from "~/lib/hooks/useActivityFeed";
const { activities, pulse, isLoading } = useActivityFeed();

// Experiments usage  
import { useExperiments, useCreateExperiment } from "~/lib/hooks/useExperiments";
const { data: experiments } = useExperiments({ status: [ExperimentStatus.Active] });

// Create experiment
const createMutation = useCreateExperiment();
await createMutation.mutateAsync({ title, description });
```

## Session Metadata
- **Date:** 2025-08-25
- **Duration:** ~4 hours (2 parts)
- **Participants:** Tiernan (Product Owner), Claude (AI Assistant)
- **Session Type:** Frontend Development - Data Layer & Core UI Components
- **Key Achievement:** Functional prototype with activity feed and 5-second creation
